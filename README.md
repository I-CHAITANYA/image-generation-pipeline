# Three-View Image Generation Pipeline

## 📋 Project Overview

Generate consistent side, front, and front three-quarter views for three different locations using open-source AI models. This pipeline produces 9 high-quality images (3 locations × 3 views) with professional-grade consistency.

## 🎯 Generated Views

For each location, the pipeline generates three standardized views:

1. **Side View** - Full profile showing complete structure
2. **Front View** - Head-on perspective emphasizing frontal features  
3. **Front Three-Quarter View** - Angled view combining front and side elements

## 📍 Target Locations

1. **Mumbai Bandra-Worli Sea Link** - Modern cable-stayed bridge
2. **Rajasthan Hawa Mahal** - Historical palace architecture
3. **Nagpur Rainforest** - Natural landscape and biodiversity
